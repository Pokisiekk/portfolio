Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains examples of my work related to test automation. The
project shows my skills in creating, implementing and managing automated tests.
I am able to write tests in any language, but in this case I focused mainly on
Robotframwrok, as it is my favorite tool to work with.

TODO - how to run tests, short description of project structure.
